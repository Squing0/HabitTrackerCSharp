# ðŸ’¬ Habit Tracker

Third project as part of the [C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/#). 
Simple console application using SQLite to track a habit and the amount of said habit done per day. 
All requirements and challenges met.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
- [X] This is an application where youâ€™ll register one habit.
- [X] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day).
- [X] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database.
- [X] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isnâ€™t present.
- [X] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [X] The app should show the user a menu of options.
- [X] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [X] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [X] The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- [X] You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You canâ€™t use mappers such as Entity Framework.

## ðŸ”’ Extra Challenges:
- [X] Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.
- [X] Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
